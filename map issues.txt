LED not turning off for inactive weather station
1. When a weather station hasn't reported in 180 minutes, the LED changes from blinking (for being >90 minutes old) to being solid again. From what I understand, it's supposed to turn off after 180 minutes of being inactive. I was able to partially fix this and make the LED keep blinking after 180 minutes, but I can't figure out how to make it turn off like it's supposed to. This was for KHLG airport.
2. When a weather station hasn't reported for so long that avationweather.gov reads "No METAR found for [airport], the LED still remains solid as described above. However, after rebooting the pi, the LED turns off like it's supposed to. This was for KUSE airport.

LED not turning off for invalid METAR
1. When a METAR does not report visibility, the LED displays the flight rule just based off the ceiling. It should turn off instead to indicate the flight rule cannot be determined. Here was the METAR from my situation if it helps, and the LED was showing solid green: KHLG 110453Z AUTO 26008KT BKN055 04/M04 A2995 RMK AO2 SLP152 T00391039 400781006 $
2. Similarly, when a METAR does not report cloud cover, the LED displays the flight rule just based off the visibility, instead of turning off to indicate invalid. Here was the METAR, and the LED was showing solid green: KHZY 170553Z AUTO 24003KT 10SM M01/M06 A3027 RMK AO2 SLP258 T10111056 10028 21011 $



**FIXED** LED dimming at sunset not working as expected
As the lights are gradually fading out during sunset, when they get to about 50% brightness, they suddenly jump back up to full brightness and continue fading out from there. The sudden jump to full brightness happens right at sunset time. So, the lights fade from 100% to 50% prior to sunset, jump to full brightness at sunset, then fade from 100% to the night light setting after sunset. This happens for all 38 airports on my map which is northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.
